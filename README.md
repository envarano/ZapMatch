# ZapMatch
ZapMatch is a grid-based puzzle game. The aim of the game is to reach the target score by matching numbers with other numbers that are 1 higher or lower than itself. You can match any amount of numbers in the same row or column as long as each number in the match is 1 higher or lower than the number before it. As you progress through the levels there are some slight changes to the rules.
